  name: 'Paul Carter',
  age: 38,
  role: 'Rhythm Guitarist & Main Vocalist',
  hometown: 'Tampa, Florida',
  bio: 'Paul discovered his love for music in grade school, where he would often hum along to songs during class, much to his teachers’ amusement. Choir became his first formal introduction to singing, and he quickly fell in love with harmonies. By high school, Paul had become known as “the guy with the guitar,” always found in a quiet corner of campus strumming chords and scribbling lyrics in a battered notebook. One pivotal moment came during his sophomore year when a teacher encouraged him to perform at a school talent show. Terrified but determined, Paul took the stage and was met with a standing ovation—a moment he calls the turning point in his life. From then on, music wasn’t just a hobby; it became his purpose. His raw, emotive voice and knack for storytelling through lyrics have made him the heart of the band.',

  age: 37,
  role: 'Bassist',
  hometown: 'Orlando, Florida (moved to Tampa at 12)',
  bio: 'Gene didn’t always see herself in the music world. In fact, her early ambitions were far from it—she wanted to be a doctor. Growing up in a family of medical professionals, Gene’s life revolved around textbooks and science fairs until the day her friend handed her an old bass guitar and jokingly said, “Fix this.” She fixed more than the instrument; she fixed her own trajectory. What started as a casual interest in music quickly grew into a passion. She taught herself to play by mimicking songs from the radio, staying up late to master every groove. By high school, she was playing in garage bands and crafting her unique style, blending precision and emotion. When Gene met the other members of Stage Fright, it was clear she’d found her true path.',

By the time she moved to Tampa, Ace was known for her wild solos and unconventional playing style.

  bio: 'Peter’s relationship with drums began when he was five years old, using pots and pans as his first drum kit. His parents, though supportive, quickly realized they needed to buy him a real drum set—anything to save the cookware. Peter grew up idolizing drummers in metal bands, studying their techniques and dreaming of one day playing in front of massive crowds. When Peter moved to Tampa as a teenager, he struggled to find his place in a new school. That changed when he joined the marching band.
