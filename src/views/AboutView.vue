      Stage Fright is made of four members (Paul Carter, Gene Martin, Ace Kinley, and Peter Winters). The boys formed the band during their freshman year of high school, and they first started making music in Ace’s garage. After many months of practice, the boys booked their first gig at the beginning of their sophomore year at their favorite local restaurant (Don’s Barbeque: Tampa, FL) and have been performing ever since.
